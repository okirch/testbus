Using testbus

In order to use testbus, all you need to do is

 a)	select a "controller" flavor to install test nodes, bring
	them up and tear them down.

	For KVM, this would be
	 ln -s /usr/bin/testbus-control-kvm /usr/bin/testbus-control

	[This step is needed if you want to do this manually; the RPMs
	provided already do this for you]

 b)	write a script that calls testbus-control to create several
 	nodes, and install it in /usr/share/testbus/suites/foobar.run

	#!/bin/bash

	image=$1
	testbus-control start node1 $image
	testbus-control start node2 $image
	testbus-control start node3 $image

	# This is the set of tests themselves
	/usr/share/testbus/suites/foobar

	testbus-control stop node1
	testbus-control stop node2
	testbus-control stop node3

 c)	write the test suite itself
 	Please consult the sample suites for an overview of how to do
	this.
