Agent:
	Agent should use well-known proxy socket?

	Monitor when the master goes away. Reconnect when that happens.

	Split code into individual source files: registration, process exec, etc

	on shutdown, call removeHost to remove ourselves (except when we were
	the ones to trigger the reboot)

	tap into ni_error and make sure we forward these to the master's error log

Server:
	Remove pid file on exit
	Fix /org/openSUSE/Testbus/Host/Host* naming

	When an agent goes away, terminate all outstanding commands on that
	host with an error

	When a host capability is added, send a signal
	When a host comes back, send a signal

	Purge syslog events after some time

Client:
	add agent-shutdown command

Proxy:
	Remove pid file on exit
	Complete serial line support

control-kvm:
	add a "restart" command that lets you restart an instance that has
	previously been shut down (for diagnostic purposes)

	add a "cleanup" command that clean up the instance directory

General:
	Support file monitors
		A monitor specifies how a system file should be watched as part
		of the test execution. For instance, you may want to take a
		snapshot of a specific /sys or /proc file before and after the
		test run. Or you may want to grab any syslog messages that were
		generated during the execution.

	Runlevel handling
		agent: scan utmp file to see what the current runlevel is
			send a signal when we find it changes

		client: wait-for-runlevel command


	ni_process_t: rename "wbuf" member
