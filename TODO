Agent:
	Agent should use well-known proxy socket?

	Monitor when the master goes away. Reconnect when that
	happens.

	Process handling: act on SIGCHLD rather than monitoring its I/O

	Split code into individual source files: registration, process exec, etc

Server:
	Remove pid file on exit
	Fix /org/openSUSE/Testbus/Host/Host* naming

	When a host capability is added, send a signal
	When a host comes back, send a signal

Client:
	make sure we can do the same as run-command using individual
	steps?

	how to wait for a process to exit if we're doing this
	in separate steps?

Proxy:
	Remove pid file on exit
	Complete serial line support

General:
	Support file monitors
		A monitor specifies how a system file should be watched as part
		of the test execution. For instance, you may want to take a
		snapshot of a specific /sys or /proc file before and after the
		test run. Or you may want to grab any syslog messages that were
		generated during the execution.

	Runlevel handling
		agent: scan utmp file to see what the current runlevel is
			send a signal when we find it changes

		client: wait-for-runlevel command
